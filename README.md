# [PAPAYA](www.papayapapaya.com)

A responsive web app that allows people to search for volunteering and charity events in their local area. 

Events can be searched for, they're displayed on a map, users can filter through the results and either favourite the event for later or register their attendance. They can also message with other users and create their own events.

The website was built during the final weeks of a Le Wagon bootcamp using Ruby, Rails, HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), PostgreSQL and Heroku.
